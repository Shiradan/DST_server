### Instruction
- Client only mod.
- You must be a Admin to use this.

> How to be a Admin?

>> If it's someone you know and can trust to be apart of the admin group, you can do the following (by manuallying doing it) steps. It works both ways in dedicated or not.

>>> 1. To become or add someone to be admin of your server, go to your documents/klei/don't starve together/client_save(HOST) or the same folder of cluster.ini(Dedicated Server) and create an adminlist.txt, if it isn't there.
>>> 2. Ask the person you want to be admin for their ID. NOT STEAM ID, but their Klei ids by having them going to the main menu, look at the bottom right to see Account Info, and grab the entire ID. Example: KU_ad39dik.
>>>> - Send command here is better way to get all IDs.
 ```
c_listallplayers()
```
>>> 3. Grab that whole KU_ad39dik and put it into your adminlist.txt. Reset your server and have the player join your game again. Hit tab and you should see a star right below their character icon.

>> - Use Steam group edit admins.

>>> Edit steam_group_id = ******* and steam_group_admins = true below [STEAM] in cluster.ini.
